# `getSPL` - Get the Security Patch Level

The `getSPL` tool retrieves the Android version and the Security Patch Level from the boot image.

The original implementation comes from [phhusson], this is cleaned up and commented so we know what the actual fuck it does (sorry my dude, but your repository absolutely *stinks*).
